Explanation of files

1. Binary_Speech_to_Text.ipynb
Finding the optimal binary model and applying the audio files

2. Combined_model.ipynb
This file contains the best models for the sentiment analysis and the emotion detection. The optimal parameters will be determined in this file and the models will be saved. 
This creates or overwrites the files:
- assets.pkl
- emotions_model.keras
- sentiment_model.keras
- tokenizer.pkl

3. Comparison AI
This compares the accuracy of our model with the Claude LLM. 
Use the API key that is provided in the report. 

4. custom_functions.py
Custom functions and layers for the models are stored here

5. DemoDiary.ipynb
Demonstration of the use of the sentiment and emotion detection

6. labels_2.csv 
Script, sentiment and emotions of the audios= files

7. mood_diary.csv
Diary entries and predictions are stored here

8. MultiLabelModel.ipynb
File used to research which is the best model to use for multilabel classification

9. PredictEmotionsSentiment.py
The prediction function is stored here. 

10. Speech_to_Text_Multiclass.ipynb
Finding the optimal multilabel model and applying the speech. 

Make use of the files
1. Run the Combined_model.ipynb
The found models will be saved together with its optimal parameters

2. Run the Demo_Diary.py
Run the code and your diary entries are stored in the CSV file, the model will predict your emotions and sentiment and store it for further analysis.
